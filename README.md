# FORMULA-1-SIMULATION-MATLAB
This project simulates a Formula 1 circuit and how a car would skid depending on its speed.

## Description

The program takes the speed of the car in a curve as input and simulates the car's behavior on the circuit. The circuit is represented by a cubic function that fits four given points.

The program calculates the length of the curve, the radius of curvature at two specific points, and the maximum allowed speed at these points to avoid skidding. If the input speed is higher than the maximum allowed speed, the program simulates the car skidding.

In addition, the program calculates the energy lost during skidding and the maximum distance that the skidding car would travel.

## Execution
To run this project, simply run the script in MATLAB and enter the speed of the car when prompted.
